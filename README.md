## Overview

Fraudulent transactions pose a significant challenge in various industries, especially in finance. Detecting such transactions accurately is crucial to prevent financial losses and maintain trust. This project aims to build a highly accurate model for detecting fraudulent transactions using XGBoost and cross-validation techniques.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danny0068/fraudulent-transaction-detection.git
cd fraudulent-transaction-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the model for predicting fraudulent transactions, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare your transaction dataset in CSV format.
2. Run the prediction script with your dataset.

```bash
python predict.py --input your_dataset.csv --output predictions.csv
```

## Model Training

The model is trained using the XGBoost algorithm. The following steps outline the training process:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model.
4. Train the final model on the entire training set.

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test â–‹
